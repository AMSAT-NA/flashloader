# Flashloader

This code is a flash loader for Texas Instruments TMS570LS0914PGE
SoC. Once this code has been loaded to to system over JTAG,
the N2HET is used as an UART that prompts the user over a
serial line and uses the YModem protocol to upload and download
software to the SoC.

## Development environment

This code has been developed using the TI multi-platform, Eclipse
based Code Composer Studio. Parts of the code has been generated
with the Windows only HALCoGen code generator. Still another
part must be assembled by the TI HET environment, again only
available on Windows!

## File Structure

### halcogen

This directory contains code that is generated by the Windows-only 
HALCoGen program.  **This code should not be edited directly.**

### loader

This directory contains the proper flash loader code.
Execution starts from `loader_main()` that is called
from the generated `main()` function in `halcogen/source/sys_main.c`

### lib

This directory contains the TI Flash Library used to
actually write the code to flash (from RAM).
